## Work in progress

Admin users will also do the same functionalities of rooms for activities and foods. Regular users will be able to view, book, or cancel activities. They will also be able to create a cart wherein they can order foods/groceries beforehand so the Admin user can track and prepare for the scheduled dates of the regular user's bookings.
